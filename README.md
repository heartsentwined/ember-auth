Versioning
==========

`ember-auth` uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) *strictly*.
Even the most minor BC-breaking change will trigger a major version bump.
That means you can safely use the
[pessimistic version constraint operator](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16#page74)
(`~> 1.2`) for rubygems, or `>= 1.2 && < 2.0` for other dependency managers.

Tests
-----

You can be lazy and just open a PR.
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org) will run the tests.

`ember-auth` tests are written in [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

1. Grab a copy of ruby. [RVM](http://rvm.io/) recommended.
2. `bundle install` to install dependencies.
3. `jasmine-headless-webkit` or `(bundle exec) rake jasmine:headless`
   to run tests, or `guard` for continuous integration testing.

`ember-auth` has been setup with [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard),
which will continuously monitor lib and spec files for changes and re-run
the tests automatically.

Building distribution js files
------------------------------

`rake dist`. Or `bundle exec rake dist` if you are not using
[RVM](http://rvm.io/), or are not otherwise scoping the bundle.
